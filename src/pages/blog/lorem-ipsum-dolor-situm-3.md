WHAT TO CONSIDER WHEN BUYING A LAPTOP FOR VIDEO EDITING (Detailed Guide)
Many young people trying to get into video editing today ask questions like, "What brand of laptop should I get?" "What factors do I look out for?" 
There are also video editors who still find it challenging to edit on the go because they do not have the right laptop.
If you fall in either of these two categories, this article has been put together just for you.
In this article, we will be exploring the factors to consider when buying a laptop for video editing. It is also important to note that the brand of a laptop is not significant in this regard; specifications are what matters.
That said, the specifications to consider are CPU, GPU, RAM, and Storage. 
Let’s get into the details!

CPU (Central Processing Unit)
The CPU is commonly called the heart of the computer. It contains cores which help it to process information. Simply put, cores equal speed. The speed with which a laptop will run depends on the number of cores contained in that laptop. 
This also means that having more cores would enable you to edit videos faster. Ensure that the CPU in the laptop you intend to get for video editing is a Quad-Core Processor, that is, contains 4 cores. When compared to a Dual Core Processor, the former is faster and smoother.

GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
Every laptop comes with 2 types of graphics card: integrated graphics or discrete graphics. These graphics cards are known as the GPU. 
With video editing, we recommend a laptop that contains a discrete GPU, rather than an integrated GPU. This is because an integrated GPU does not have its own memory and storage- VRAM (Video Random Access Memory), it shares memory with the CPU on a laptop.
Whereas, the discrete GPU has its own memory (VRAM) for imagery processing, which means that it works faster than an integrated graphics card. 
Speaking of, kindly note that the minimum GPU for video editing is 2GB; not more, not less.

RAM (Random Access Memory)
The RAM is used to temporarily store information. So, when video editors edit and make changes to a video, the RAM is what helps to temporarily store those edits and changes. This means that the more video editing you do, the more RAM you need.
Take, for instance, you’re editing a 4K video, you’d naturally need about 32GB. Notwithstanding, bear in mind that the minimum RAM for video editing is 8GB.
Kindly remember that when buying your laptop.

STORAGE
The storage factor is, most times, the least talked about when it comes to choosing a laptop for video editing. It is, however, just as important as the CPU, GPU, and RAM.
There are two kinds of storage to consider for video editing: HDD and SDD. While there are many options to choose from as far as external storage is concerned, it is best to stick with one that ensures sufficiency.
The SDD (Solid State Drive) is a newer and faster version of the HDD (Hard Disk Drive), so it is highly recommended because it makes video editing smoother and faster.
However, because it is quite expensive and can be a bit of a challenge, especially where budget is a concern, it is okay to work with the HDD instead. It might not be the fastest, but it functions well enough. 

CONCLUSION
Contrary to what most people think, the brand of a laptop does not determine whether or not it is good enough for video editing. Whether it is HP or Dell, if they do not contain the above specifications, then you might not enjoy film editing while using them.
Likewise, you won’t enjoy film editing if you decide to get any kind of laptop without asking questions. It could be because you’re working with a particular price range, however, it is best to know these specifications, then factor them into your budget.
