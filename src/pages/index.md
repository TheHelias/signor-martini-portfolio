    quote: Martini is my go-to guy when it comes to video editing and coloring.
      Martini and I have been working together for about three years, and itâ€™s
      been a very great partnership. He has helped improve how I shoot and how I
      tell stories through videography. He has also edited over 30 individual
      videos for me, each coming with their own unique creative touch.
