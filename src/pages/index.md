    quote: Martini is my go-to guy when it comes to video editing and coloring.
      Martini and I have been working together for about two years, and it’s
      been a very great partnership. He has helped improve how I shoot and how I
      tell stories through videography. He has also edited over 30 individual
      videos for me, each coming with their own unique creative touch. He is
      enjoyable to work with and delivers on time.   I think one of his greatest
      attributes is listening to what you want in your edits and then giving you
      a perfect result. I recommend Martini 100 times over, you can trust that
      whatever work you give him; big or small, he would put his whole heart in
      making sure it’s the best it could ever be.

Hi, I'm Martini Akande. Yes, Martini is my real name (inserts a long story). I'm a Professional Film and Video Editor, Colorist, Sound Editor, and Post Production Consultant.

I have over 4 years post production experience creating commercials, TVs, films, music videos, documentaries, web series etc. 

I'm a Mechanic: I join cuts together to make them work as a unit. 

I'm a Collaborator: I work with other professionals like cinematographers and sound composers. 

I'm an Artist: I bring the director's or client's vision to life. 

I love telling stories. I believe every visual content must tell a story and I put this in every cut, every frame, every note.

Thanks for visiting my website. Please, take a look at some of my work and do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or wish to get in touch with me.
