    quote: Martini is my go-to guy when it comes to video editing and coloring.
      Martini and I have been working together for about three years, and itâ€™s
      been a very great partnership. He has helped improve how I shoot and how I
      tell stories through videography. He has also edited over 30 individual
      videos for me, each coming with their own unique creative touch.

Hi, I'm Martini Akande. Yes, Martini is my real name (inserts a long story). I'm a Professional Film and Video Editor, Colorist, and Post Production Consultant.

I have over 5 years post production experience creating commercials, TVs, films, music videos, documentaries, web series etc. 

I'm a Mechanic: I join cuts together to make them work as a unit. 

I'm a Collaborator: I work with other professionals like cinematographers and sound composers. 

I'm an Artist: I bring the director's or client's vision to life. 

I love telling stories. I believe every visual content must tell a story and I put this in every cut, every frame, every note.

Thanks for visiting my website. Please, take a look at some of my work and do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or wish to get in touch with me.
